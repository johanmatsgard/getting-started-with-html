  My name is <b>Johan Matsgard</b>. 
  
  <p>I live in Stockholm <em>(Sweden)</em> and I haven't coded anything since like 1999 or so. I thought it was prime time for me to dust off my knowledge and spend some time reviewing everything starting with the pure basics. I'm looking forward to pushing myself as far as possible and see where that may take me. By the end of this year I intend to have all the knowledge needed to empower myself and my business <b>further</b>.

  <p>Who knows, maybe I will get so into programming that I'll even want to take become a full stack developer.</p>

  <p><b><em>We will have to see what the future holds!</em></b></p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<h3>Stage 0: The basics of the Web and HTML</h3>

<div class="block1">
<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>This may be a bit too basic, but ... The web is a bunch 
  of computers that communicate with each other. When a person 
  goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends 
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds 
  the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's 
  computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and 
  displays it on the user's screen.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block2">
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML 
  documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML 
  documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes 
  "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
</p>
</div>

<div class="block1">
<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by 
  using HTML <b>tags</b>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block2">
<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block1">
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
